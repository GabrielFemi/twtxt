ðŸ“• twtxt is a Self-Hosted, Twitterâ„¢-like Decentralised microBlogging platform. No ads, no tracking, your content!

Technically `twtxt` is a [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) client in the form
of a web application. It supports multiple users and
also hosts user feeds directly.

There is also a publicly (_free_) service online available at:

- https://twtxt.net/

> __NOTE:__ I [James Mills](https://github.com/prologic) run this first (_of which I hope to be many_) `twtxt` instance on pretty cheap hardware on a limited budget. Please use it fairly so everyone can enjoy using it equally! Please be sure to read the [/privacy](https://twtxt.net/privacy) before singing up (_pretty striaght forward_) and happy Twt'ing! ðŸ¤—

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

As a first point, please try to use one of the pre-built binaries  that are
available on the [Releases](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/releases) page.

### Building from source

This is an option if you are familiar with [Go](https://golang.org) development.

1. Clone this repository (_this is important_)

```console
git clone https://github.com/prologic/twtxt.git
```

2. Install required dependencies (_this is important_)

```console
make deps
```

3. Build the binaries

```console
make
```

__NOTE___: It is important you follow these steps and don't just simply attempt
           `go get ...` this project as that will not work (#30) due to the
           need to package templates and static assets which we use the
           [go.rice](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice) tool for.

## Production Deployments

### Docker Swarm

You can deploy `twtxt` to a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)
cluster by utilsing the provided `twtxt.yaml` Docker Stack. This also depends on
and uses the [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) ingres load balancer so you must
also have that configured and running in your cluster appropriately.
